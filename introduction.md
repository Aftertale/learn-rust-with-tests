# Introduction
---
Welcome to Learning Rust with Tests! At the moment, this is still very much a work in progress, so I hope that if you see a mistake, something I'm missing, or just something you'd like to see added, you will [fill out an issue in github](https://github.com/Aftertale/learn-rust-with-tests/issues). 

## Conventions
This book is written to be published with gitbook.io, much like the [book that inspired it](https://quii.gitbook.io/learn-go-with-tests). The following conventions will be followed:
> Code Blocks will be seperated into a monospaced box and omitted lines will be indicated with ellipses (...)
```rust
fn main() {
  hello("Aftertale")
}

fn hello(name: str) {
  ...
}
```

> Terminal Commands are displayed in monospaced type and the prompt will be represented by a '$'
`$ cargo new hello_world`
